# Türkiye İl Plakaları - python edition
Python port of Türkiye İl Plakaları by @cambazm
## How do I use it?
Download the python script from the latest <a href="https://github.com/sctech-tr/turkiye-il-plakalari-py/releases/latest">release</a> and run it. If it cannot fetch the cities, open an issue.
## How does it work?
1. The script fetches the city list from <a href="https://turkiye-il-plakalari.gamerselimiko.workers.dev/cities">here</a>
2. It makes the main window

That's all!
## Why?
for fun
## How do I host the worker?
1. Open a cloudflare worker
2. Paste the contents of worker.js into it
3. Update the python script to match your worker url
